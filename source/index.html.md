# Stats Dashboard

## Overview

This screen shows key nutritional stats for a single meal or entire day. The dashboard is a fully customizable screen that let’s you specify what stats matter for each client. 

At a high level, there’s a Targets and Overview section. Each section contains various widgets that help visualize clients’ daily intake.

# Billing

## General

Your clients will receive a monthly subscription price of $50/mo, down 40% from the $70/mo pricing for the general public.

For now, it's easiest if you bundle in our pricing when you charge clients for your services. We'll then bill you via credit card, with each client as a seperate line item.

To get going, we'll take your credit card info over the phone, and manage client subscriptions over email.

## Refund Policy
We offer a 100% money back guarantee if clients are not happy during their first 7 days of usage.

## Cancellation Policy
Clients can cancel at any time by giving us a 2min phone call to help us figure out what went wrong. They'll continue to have access to the app for the remainder of the billing cycle (ie. last 2 weeks of the month), after which they won't be charged anymore.
